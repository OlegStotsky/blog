## Five simple productivity hacks that make me 20x more productive
Here is a list of things that I do that allow me to stay focused, energized, and distraction-free throughout the day:

### Not using phone for 1 hour after waking up
It always feels like whenever I start my day by immediately using the phone, I can’t resist the urge to use it throughout the day afterward. 
When I don’t use it for 1 hour after waking up I don’t feel the need to check social media/etc. for almost the entire day afterward. 
One thing that aids me in this is the [one-sec app](https://one-sec.app/). 
It allows you to block certain apps for some time after you wake up (by syncing with your Apple Health schedule).

### Keeping phone in some distant location where it’s hard to access
Plain and simple: if it takes a lot of energy to use your phone, you will be more likely to use it only when you really need it. I usually keep it in my backpack or in my jacket if it’s winter. 
I only access it during my pomodoro timer breaks (which is only a few minutes per hour).

### Using one-sec app
This one has been one of the biggest game-changers for me. 
This app makes you wait for a few seconds before you can open certain applications and before it opens them it asks you if you still really want to open them. 
Surprisingly, this has been the only app blocker that has worked for me and helped me to reduce my urges to open/browse distracting up to almost ZERO.

### Meditating in the morning
This one goes in the same bucket with not using phone for 1 hour after waking up: it feels like the first hour of the day mostly determines how I will spend the rest of it and meditating for 8-10m in the morning makes me extremely calm and focused for the rest of the day.

### Buying Apple Watch
Getting apple watched has helped me massively with the urge of having some device (a phone mostly, I'm sure most people reading this will know what I'm talking about) near me/in my hands when I'm alone/I'm eating/etc., but since it has 
none of the distractions of the phone, It doesn't really consume my attention and acts as a sort substitute for phone to my addicted mind.
It also allowed me to use some good features of the phone (calendar, some urgent reminders, etc.) without the addictive/distracting downside.
